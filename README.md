## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - JS library
-   [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/) - Custom Icon Fonts
-   [https://pqina.nl/tick/#flip](https://pqina.nl/tick/#flip) - Tick Flip Library

### What I learned

I used this project to practice Vue and CSS transitions. One of the main things I learned was how to do transitions with Vue.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn how to create Vue applications that utilize transitions and animations to create beautiful looking apps.

### Useful resources

-   [Tick Flip](https://pqina.nl/tick/#flip) - This helped me because I was able to quickly deploy a high-fidelity looking countdown timer with minimal work. This library was easily deployable and easily customizable.
-   [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - While I have been doing web devlopment for several years, watching Kevin Powell's YouTube channel has helped keep my CSS knowledge up to date.
