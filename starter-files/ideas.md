after about 30 seconds have a ufo come in and "light up everything"

or create some sort of 3D like shadow with light behind the counters

"rays of light" perhaps?

restrict it to a specific aspect ratio "letterbox style"

maybe have a rocket animate across the sky every once in a while

from now to the target date have a Moon icon like the sun SLOWLY come to the same position as the sun.

when the target date is met -- show sun..

provide tools -- for example:

have a "control panel"

-   ability to change the 4/5 colors on the fly
-   ability to change the date (maybe time?)
-   abilith to "speed things up" - i.e - simulate a "fast forward" time / countdownf

--

if it's in day mode

Every once in a while have a plane with chem trails go across the screen.

recreate this UFO in CSS only:

add a glowing moon for dark mode

have the dark / light mode auto switch on day/night settings.

integrate some API for that
